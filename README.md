### Syntax
 - if the letter isn't in the word, use `[l]`
 - if the letter is in the word but not that position, use `(o)`
 - if the letter is on correct place, use `r`

For example `(a),r,o,[s],[e]` means that `a` is there but not on the first position, `r` and `o` are correct
and `s` and `e` aren't the word at all.
